# Replication Package

This repository contains the replication package for the paper:

**Exploring Direct Instruction and Summary-Mediated Prompting in LLM-Assisted Code Modification**  
*VL/HCC 2025 â€” IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing*

The package is organized as follows:

- **`pasta-plugin/`**  
  Source code and resources for the IntelliJ plugin PASTA used in the study.  

- **`qual-analysis/`**  
  Materials for qualitative analysis.  
  - `codebook.pdf`: Codebook for interview analysis.
  - `coded_quotes.csv`: Anonymized, coded interview segments.

- **`quant-analysis/`**  
  Materials for quantitative analysis.  
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies. After installing them, all Jupyter notebooks can be run successfully.
  - `analysis/`: Jupyter notebooks, data files, and result figures for quantitative analysis.
    - `data/`: Contains task outcomes, prompt strategy selections, and questionnaire responses (e.g., NASA-TLX, perceived utility, and self-reported experience).
    - `figures/`: Contains all result figures presented in the paper, generated by the notebooks.
  - `interactions/`: JSON files of all participants' interaction logs.
  - `transcription/`: Audio transcription scripts.
  - `analysis.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook for all quantitative results reported in the paper.
  - `utility.ipynb`: Focused analysis of Likert-scale utility ratings.

- **`study-protocol/`**  
  Study protocol documents in PDF format, including all questionnaires and a facilitator-used study procedure (e.g., introduction for PASTA, scripts for semi-structured interviews).

- **`study-tasks/`**  
  Programming tasks used in the study.  
  - `buggy-code/`: Initial code given to participants.
  - `ground-truth/`: Reference solutions.
  - `task-descriptions/`: Task instructions and related images.
